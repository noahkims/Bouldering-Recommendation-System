# Bouldering-Recommendation-System

Joshua Tree National Park is a popular bouldering and sport climbing spot in Southern California, but finding routes to climb on your first trip or even consequent trips may be difficult without an experienced guide. 

Mountain project is a great database of routes supported by the community, and while it provides filters such as popularity and grade level, it may be hard to choose which ones you'd want to climb.

This recommendation system is aimed to provide a solution, recommending routes based on ones you've done before!
